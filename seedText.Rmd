# **Summary**  
Shellfish incorporate nutrients into their tissues and shell as they grow. At harvest, these nutrients are permanently removed from the coastal environment, providing a benefit to water quality in the form of excess nutrient reduction. The harvest of `r params[["seedNumber"]]` seed oysters at an average size of `r  params[["seedsize"]]` mm is expected to result in the removal of a total of `r round(params[["Nplot"]]$data$N[3], 2)` pounds (lbs) of nitrogen and `r round(params[["Pplot"]]$data$P[3], 2)` pounds (lbs) of phosphorus when removed from the system.
